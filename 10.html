  <h2>Welcome to the dumbest and also one of the proudest projects ever been made(please do not take this too serious from your professional view because you-know-why) !</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is BOTSON, and unlike my boss, I can only tell the truth :). First of all, he is very sorry about what he said, even more when he realized how much it upsetted you - his very good friend. This project is made just from one of his crazy ideas as a form of an apology. The guy has very little to no coding experience before doing this if it means anything about his sincerity.</p>

  <p>But seriously, my boss told me to say that anything you just read and are about to see is 100% the truth, so do not think too hard about it, just take things at face value. Anyway, it is probably the easiest format you have ever seen, but it literally killed my boss mentally and physically to do this, so...</p>

  <p>Bottomline, in any situation DO NOT RELOAD the page or the link because it will most likely crash and ruin this experience. Also, going back is NOT an option, so think carefully, my friend. That is all, GLHF.</p>

  <h2>There you have it! I hope you are satisfied with this experience. Thank you for taking your time to get to this point; it means a lot to my boss. Once again, he just wants you to know that he is deeply sorry for his insensitive actions, and there's no excuse. He really meant it, probably just too dumb to express it -_-.</h2>

  <p>It was only for a short time, but it was my pleasure, and I hope to see you again in another project (who knows, the boss has the final say in this anyway).</p>

  <p>Yeah, and I did not forget. The last question you can ask is... Well, you will have to ask the boss directly. The question is up to you, and he will answer anything with complete honesty. It is easy to know if he will be lying or not because it will HAVE to be a YES-NO question only (so only a 50% chance he's lying if my math is correct). Take a screenshot if you want to make sure, although the boss would never go back on his word. That is it! #BOTSONOUT.</p>
